/* =========================================================================
   PHASE 1 — JOB / SHIPMENT MASTER ENGINE
   =========================================================================
   Adds a central "Logistics Job / Shipment File" entity that becomes the
   source-of-truth transaction context for every document a student fills
   in, sitting ON TOP of the existing document-to-document transaction
   context already built in workflow-rules.js (skGetTransactionContext).

   This file is purely additive:
     - No existing function signature in engine.js / workflow-rules.js /
       documents-data.js changes.
     - Nothing here is required for the pre-Phase-1 simulator (no job
       created) to keep working exactly as it did before — skGetJobContext()
       simply returns {} until a student creates a Job.
     - Everything is scoped per student (localStorage, same pattern as
       skGetAllProgress in auth.js), so lab computers still don't need a
       shared backend for this phase.

   WHAT THIS PHASE DOES NOT DO YET (later phases, per the master prompt):
     - No scenario templates (Phase 5) — the student fills the Job form
       themselves for now.
     - No cross-document mismatch warnings (Phase 3) — if a student edits a
       job-sourced value inside a document, that correction is NOT currently
       propagated back into the shared Job Master or flagged as a mismatch.
       This is a deliberate Phase-1 simplification: the Job Master is the
       single source of truth and documents consume/verify it, they don't
       yet feed corrections back upstream. Flagging for domain review before
       Phase 3, as instructed.
     - No scoring/audit/instructor dashboard hooks (Phases 6/7).

   e.g. picking VGM Certificate + Insurance Certificate + Shipping
   Instructions without Booking Confirmation / Commercial Invoice / Sales

   PHASE 5 — SCENARIO TEMPLATES
   Pre-built realistic Job Master starting points, so a student doesn't have
   to invent every shipment detail from scratch before they can even begin.
   Each template supplies the SAME fields JOB_FIELD_MAP already defines —
   picking one just pre-fills the Job creation form, which the student can
   still edit before (or after) creating the Job. Nothing here bypasses
   verification: it's a starting point, not an autofill-and-forget shortcut.

   Scope note: this phase does NOT yet filter which of the 81 documents are
   "required" vs "optional" per scenario, or enforce mode-specific workflow
   branching (e.g. hiding Bill of Lading fields for a Road scenario) — that
   is Phase 8 in the master prompt (mode-specific workflows), a separate,
   later step. Every document remains available regardless of scenario,
   exactly as it does today.

/* =========================================================================
   PHASE 8 — MODE-SPECIFIC WORKFLOWS
   =========================================================================
   Classifies which of the 81 documents genuinely apply to which of the 6
   Job modes, based on (a) each document's own moduleLabel in
   documents-data.js, and (b) its real position in the PREREQUISITES chain
   in workflow-rules.js (e.g. Mate Receipt only ever appears in the sea leg
   of that chain, so it's Sea-only regardless of label; Dispatch Note
   appears both in the road-to-port leg AND is labeled "Warehouse
   Documentation", so it's tagged for both).

   This is INFORMATIONAL ONLY, per the master prompt's own "do not over-
   automate" instruction (section 15) — a document not applicable to the
   active Job's mode is labeled as such and excluded from that Job's
   completion denominator, but a student can still open and complete it.
   Nothing here changes lock/unlock logic (PREREQUISITES, section 6) or
   removes access to any of the 81 documents.

   A handful of these are genuinely ambiguous even after checking both
   signals (e.g. whether Purchase Order/RFQ/Vendor Bill represent a
   separate domestic-procurement track or are themselves part of importing
   raw materials internationally) — those are tagged ALL_MODES (available
   everywhere, never marked "not applicable"), which is the safe default
   whenever the classification was uncertain rather than guessing narrow.
