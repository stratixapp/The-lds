/* =========================================================================
   SKELORA INSTITUTE LOGISTICS SIMULATOR — WORKFLOW RULES & TRANSACTION CONTEXT
   Two things live here, both purely additive — nothing in engine.js's
   rendering, validation, or storage functions is modified:

   1. PREREQUISITES — a real dependency graph (not just "previous item in a
      list"). A document can only be started once every document listed as
      its direct prerequisite has status "completed" for this student, on
      this computer. Because a document can only ever have been completed
      by *also* passing its own prerequisite check, requiring only the
      *direct* parents here is sufficient — transitive requirements (e.g.
      Packing List requiring Commercial Invoice requiring Sales Order) are
      automatically enforced by the chain itself.

   2. TRANSACTION CONTEXT — a small derived store, keyed per student, that
      carries forward shared transaction data (buyer/seller identity,
      PO/invoice/container numbers, ports, vessel, currency, HS codes, line
      items...) from completed documents into new ones. Individual fields
      opt in via an additive `contextKey` property already living on the
      field definition in documents-data.js (documents built before this
      feature carry no `contextKey` and simply don't participate — nothing
      about them changes). Context favours whichever completed document is
      *earliest* in the real workflow for a given key, since that's the
      document that actually originates that fact in the real world (e.g.
      the buyer's name is authoritative from the Sales Order, not whatever
      a much later Warehouse Receipt happens to also carry).
   ========================================================================= */

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   1. PREREQUISITES
   Slug -> array of slugs that must be status:"completed" first.
   Independent/parallel starting points (registration, master data,
   internal procurement, vehicle-level docs) intentionally have no
   prerequisite — they don't block, and nothing should block on them
   unless they genuinely feed the same transaction.

   3. CROSS-DOCUMENT VALIDATION (Phase 3)
   Compares a document's own submitted values, for every field or table
   column that carries a contextKey, against the SAME canonical
   transaction context built in section 2 (Job Master + earliest completed
   document). This is deliberately scoped to values that already share one
   contextKey — i.e. genuinely the same fact restated in two places (the
   same buyer name, the same container number, the same HS code) — not an
   invented business rule comparing two conceptually different numbers.

   One example from the ERP-upgrade brief is explicitly NOT handled here:
   Commercial Invoice weight vs. VGM weight. Those are legitimately
   different figures in the real world (invoice/packing weight vs. the
   SOLAS-verified gross mass of the packed container including tare), and
   documents-data.js correctly does NOT tag them with the same contextKey.
   Comparing them would need an explicit, named tolerance rule from you —
   flagging for domain review rather than inventing one, per the master
   prompt's own instruction not to guess at logistics rules.

   This is warning-level and non-blocking: a student can still complete a
   document with a flagged mismatch. Phase 13 (final job audit) is where a
   mismatch would actually count against completion — not this phase.

   4. STUDENT SCORING + FINAL JOB AUDIT (Phase 6)

   Deliberately built ONLY from data this simulator can genuinely measure,
   rather than inventing scores for things it has no way to verify:

   - Workflow Completion: real — every document's status is already
     tracked in the progress store.
   - Cross-Document Consistency: real — reuses the exact Phase 3 mismatch
     engine, counting every contextKey comparison actually performed
     across every completed document, not just the failures.
   - "Documentation Accuracy" / "Valid Formats" from the master prompt's
     scoring list are NOT scored separately here, because engine.js's
     validateStep() already REQUIRES every required field to be present
     and pattern-valid before a document can be marked complete — a
     completed document is by construction 100% on both, so scoring it
     again would just be redundant, not a real signal.
   - "Calculation Accuracy" is not scored: every computed field in
     documents-data.js is derived with a fixed formula (deps + compute),
     so it cannot be wrong by construction either — there's no incorrect
     total for a student to have entered.
   - Time Taken / Number of Attempts are shown as INFORMATION ONLY, never
     scored, per the master prompt's own instruction not to make speed
     more important than correctness — and because turning them into a
     score would require an arbitrary "good" time/attempt threshold this
     simulator has no real basis for. They're read from the existing
     audit log (skAppendAudit's "started"/"completed" entries in
     auth.js), not from any new tracking.
